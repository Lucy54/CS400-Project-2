Brief Project Description:
<brief project description here: 1) what will the app that you are developing do, and 2) who would use an application like this and why>

1) In this project, the team will create a red black tree storing nodes with data such as the player’s name and his rating. The application that we will be developing will basically offer functions such as searching for players with the highest and lowest rating. The public domain can also have access to all the players’ ratings in sequence from lowest ranked player to the highest ranked player (ex. Calling a toString() to go through each node of the black red tree from the left-most child to the rightmost child—by levels based on his rating). This will be shown in string representation containing players’ names and ratings. Optionally, people could also add another basketball player by their choice (can be any basketball player) to the application to see how that specific player ranked (in terms of rating) when compared to all the Lakers’ players of 2020. The same applies for removing, the user can also try to remove a particular player from the red black tree as well to see how the rating system will change as the result of adding or removing a player from the tree. 

2) The targeted population of our application could be the people who are interested in the NBA (for this application though, we will be focusing on one of the most renowned basketball teams, Lakers) and who demonstrate curiosity as to the performance of each player shown in the form of numerical representation such as his rating.
